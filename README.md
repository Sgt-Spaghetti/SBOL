## Guide

* To add a glyph to the diagram, click on the **"available glyphs"** drop-down menu, and then select the desired glyph.
* To delete a glyph, press the "delete" button near the bottom of the page. This will delete the **newest-added** glyph.
* To add text annotations, write the desired text in the text box near the bottom of the page, and press the **"add text"** button. This will add a label below the **newest-added** glyph. The text width of the **newest-added** glyph can be changed with the respective buttons. 
* To save the diagram, **right click** in the canvas (over the diagram) and press "save as".
* A "Quick Add" menu is available, simply **right click** on a glyph button to bring up a list of commonly used labels, which will automatically be added and the glyph will be placed if that button is selected. There is also an option to toggle adding the labels to the center of the glyph instead of below it.

Glyphs are added progressively, left to right. All operations available affect the last added glyph, in other words the right-most one.

Drag and Drop functionality is also supported, simply drag a glyph from the top anywhere onto the canvas, and it will be dropped in place. Any subsequent actions (eg. changing the font size, or deleting) will then affect that glyph until another is placed.
