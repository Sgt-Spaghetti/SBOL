## Guide

* To add a glyph to the diagram, click on the **"available glyphs"** drop-down menu, and then select the desired glyph.
* To delete a glyph, press the "delete" button near the bottom of the page. This will delete the **newest-added** glyph.
* To add text annotations, write the desired text in the text box near the bottom of the page, and press the **"add text"** button. This will add a label below the **newest-added** glyph. The text width of the **newest-added** glyph can be changed with the respective buttons. 
* To save the diagram, **right click** in the canvas (over the diagram) and press "save as".

Glyphs are added progressively, left to right. All operations available affect the last added glyph, in other words the right-most one.
